# Lab - Kalman Filters

This is a lab of the course in which an EKF package (Extended Kalman Filter) is used alongside with turtlebot 2 and other important packages. Since all these packages are downloaded from github repositories, some of the folders are linked to their respective git repositories and therefore cannot be opened here. They are here with their original names, so it is easier to download them when needed.

The main purpose of this lab being in this repo is to remember these usefull packages in the future (in case it is needed). So this folder here won't run on your machine as it is right now.
